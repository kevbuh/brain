# brain

recreating the neocortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, amygdala, and thalamus.

based off of the findings in ["A Brief History of Intelligence"](https://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Intelligence-Humans-Breakthroughs/dp/0063286343) by Max Bennet and [geohot](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2024/03/27/where-the-bitter-lesson-ends.html)

## Brain Areas

Neocortex
- transformer
- simulation (frontal)
- model based
- allows for few shot learning
Hippocampus
- really good RAG
  
Basal Ganglia
- TD-learning
- automatic
- model-free
  
Amygdala

Thalamus
